                        <p>Acting on insights gained through community engagement over the past year, VMware has decided to offer a free download of VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in place of VMware Tanzu Community Edition software and to retire the Tanzu Community Edition open source project. Users can download Tanzu Kubernetes Grid <a href='https://www.vmware.com/go/get-tkg'>here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Cloud native practitioners value free and easy access to a version of Tanzu software with which they can experiment and explore. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, available as a free download, offers a conformant Kubernetes runtime solution built on open source, offers capabilities similar to Tanzu Community Edition, and provides a frictionless upgrade path to commercial Tanzu offerings.</p>

                        <p>No. Building open source software and contributing to the community is central to VMware’s engineering and innovation. VMware continues to develop and open source new technologies, contribute to existing open source projects, and leverage many of them in the <a href='https://tanzu.vmware.com/open-source'>Tanzu platform</a>. More information about VMware open source initiatives can be found <a href='https://www.vmware.com/opensource.html'>here</a>. </p>

                        <p>The Tanzu Community Edition open source project will be retired by the end of this calendar year (Dec 2022).

                        <p>Yes.  All of the software that had been offered with Tanzu Community Edition is open source, freely available from upstream project sites and repositories and can be used with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. Find a visual catalog of these technologies above.</p>

                        <p><br/>No. VMware recognizes that Tanzu’s strength is in providing advanced multi-cloud and multi-cluster capabilities and that our role in the community must be to add value there rather than targeting simpler environments already well served by existing solutions such as Minikube and KinD.</p>
